//The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

//JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types.

//JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0

//JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies.

//A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made. (change made in copy also change original array)

//A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same references

const myArr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
